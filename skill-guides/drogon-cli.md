# Drogon CLI

Use `drogon-cli` when the Drogon daemon is the source of truth. It is the
only supported way for an agent inside a Drogon terminal to inspect or drive
Drogon state: never reach into daemon files or sockets directly.

## Start Here

The executable is `drogon-cli` on `PATH`. It talks to the local daemon over
the data directory: pass `--data-dir <PATH>` or export `DROGON_DATA_DIR`.
Prefer `--json` for agent-driven calls; human output is a summary of the
same result.

```text
drogon-cli status --json
```

If the CLI is missing, say so explicitly instead of inspecting source files.
For the full machine-readable surface, run
`drogon-cli agent-context --json` (local, no daemon needed).

## Inside A Drogon Terminal

Every shell or agent the daemon spawns already has Drogon on `PATH`: the
daemon prepends its `<data-dir>/bin` directory, which holds two names for
the same CLI — `drogon-cli` and the shorter alias `drogon`. Inside, drop
`--data-dir`: the shim binds the running daemon's data directory on its
own, and the session environment already exports `DROGON_DATA_DIR`,
`DROGON_WORKSPACE_ID`, `DROGON_SESSION_ID` and `DROGON_TERMINAL=1`.

```text
drogon-cli status --json
drogon-cli terminal list --json
```

Prefer `drogon-cli` in scripts and shared prompts; `drogon` is a
keystroke-saver for interactive use. Both resolve to the CLI that belongs
to the running daemon, never to another install on `PATH`.

## Status And Capabilities

`drogon-cli status` shows the daemon identity, protocol version and
capability list. Gate optional work on capabilities: `harness.catalog.v1`
and `harness.launch.v1` for harness commands, `orchestration.native.v1`
for the orchestration verbs, `project.v1` and `worktree.v1` for projects
and worktrees, `git.v1` for Git operations, `session.agent-state.v1`
for agent-state fields on sessions, and `browser.relay.v1` for the browser
commands below (which additionally need a connected Drogon desktop).

Run `drogon-cli status --json` first, then the narrowest command for the
job. The full guide for supervised coordination is one guide away:
`drogon-cli skills get --topic orchestration`.

## Workspaces

A workspace is a registered directory that owns terminal sessions. List
them with `drogon-cli workspace list --json`, and register one with
`drogon-cli workspace add <PATH> --name <NAME>`.

## Projects And Worktrees

A project is a Git repository or a plain folder that owns worktrees.
Register one with `drogon-cli project add <PATH> --name <NAME>`, list
them with `drogon-cli project list --json`, and drop a registration with
`drogon-cli project remove <ID>` (bookkeeping only: files on disk are
untouched). Create a worktree on a branch
with `drogon-cli worktree create --project <ID> --name <NAME> --base <REF>`
(`--base-branch` spells the same flag),
list a project's worktrees with `drogon-cli worktree list --project <ID>`,
and remove one with `drogon-cli worktree rm <ID> --force`. Removal refuses
a dirty checkout unless `--force` is passed.

## Terminals

Sessions are PTY processes with a stable id plus an incarnation token:
every `send`, `read`, `resize`, `wait` and `close` needs both. Start one
with `drogon-cli terminal create --workspace <ID> -- echo hi` (everything
after `--` becomes argv verbatim, no shell interpolation), and scope a
listing with `drogon-cli terminal list --workspace <ID>` or list all with
`drogon-cli terminal list --json`.

Write input with `drogon-cli terminal send --session <ID> --incarnation <TOKEN> --text <TEXT>`.
To send Enter, end the value with a real newline (shell `$'...'` quoting),
not the two characters backslash-n. Read bounded output with
`drogon-cli terminal read --session <ID> --incarnation <TOKEN> --cursor 0 --limit-bytes 4096`,
then keep paging with the returned `nextCursor` while `truncated` is true.
Resize with `drogon-cli terminal resize --session <ID> --incarnation <TOKEN> --cols 80 --rows 24`,
and stop a session with `drogon-cli terminal close --session <ID> --incarnation <TOKEN>`.

Wait client-side instead of sleeping: `drogon-cli terminal wait --session <ID> --incarnation <TOKEN> --for exited --timeout-ms 5000`
exits 0 once the session exits, while
`drogon-cli terminal wait --session <ID> --incarnation <TOKEN> --for tui-idle --timeout-ms 60000`
exits 0 once the agent goes quiet (an exited session also satisfies an
idle wait, since it will never work again), and
`--for` also accepts the fork spellings `exit` (= `exited`) and
`tui-idle` (= `idle`):
`drogon-cli terminal wait --session <ID> --incarnation <TOKEN> --for output --timeout-ms 60000`
exits 0 once any terminal output exists or arrives. A blown budget exits
non-zero with a `timeout` reason naming the last observed state. Always
pass `--timeout-ms` (1 to 900000).

## Browser

The desktop owns one embedded browser pane per workspace. Each command
enqueues a relay request and waits (bounded, `--timeout-ms 5000` overrides
the 15000 default, range 1 to 25000) for the connected desktop to execute
it; with no desktop connected the call fails with `desktop_not_connected`
inside the timeout. Open a URL with
`drogon-cli browser open --workspace <ID> <URL>`, move an open tab with
`drogon-cli browser navigate --tab <ID> <URL>`, and read a tab's URL, title
and bounded DOM text with `drogon-cli browser snapshot --tab <ID>`.
Interact with the page through CSS selectors resolved with
`document.querySelector` in the guest:
`drogon-cli browser click --tab <ID> --selector <CSS>` clicks the match and
`drogon-cli browser fill --tab <ID> --selector <CSS> --text <TEXT>` fills
it. List a workspace's tabs with `drogon-cli browser tabs --workspace <ID>`.
Inside a Drogon terminal both spellings work with no `--data-dir` flag:
`drogon-cli browser open --workspace <ID> <URL>` or the shorter `drogon`
alias — the shim is already on `PATH`.

## Harness Launch

`drogon-cli harness list --json` shows the harnesses the service host can
actually run. Launch one with
`drogon-cli harness start --workspace <ID> --harness <HARNESS> --prompt <PROMPT>`,
optionally pinning the model and permission mode:
`drogon-cli harness start --workspace <ID> --harness <HARNESS> --model <MODEL> --permission-mode unattended --prompt <PROMPT>`.
The service resolves the host executable, so there is never a local binary
to point at. A harness id is server-authoritative: pass it through
verbatim as advertised by `harness list`.

## Liveness And Agent State

Every session reports a liveness verdict and an agent state. Verdicts are
`live`, `unverifiable` or `exited`: loss of contact never proves exit, so
treat `unverifiable` as unknown and keep the session identity for a later
read. Agent states are `working` (output within the last few seconds),
`idle` (quiet after earlier activity), `needs_input` (the agent asked for
input), `exited`, and `unknown` (no output observed yet, so idleness was
never established). Only an observed exit is an exit.

## Errors

- Usage errors (bad flags, missing `--timeout-ms`, empty ids) exit 2 with
  a message on stderr and nothing on stdout.
- Operation failures exit 1. Under `--json` the failure envelope goes to
  stdout; otherwise `error: <code>: <message>` goes to stderr.
- `terminal close` exits 1 when the runtime cannot confirm the session
  exited, even though it prints the session line.
- `terminal wait` exits 1 with code `timeout` when the budget expires.
- `browser` commands exit 1 with code `desktop_not_connected` when no
  Drogon desktop is connected to execute them.
- The diagnostic passthrough `drogon-cli rpc status` sends one raw
  protocol method and prints the validated envelope.

## Next Action

Confirm `drogon-cli status --json` unless already checked this turn, then
choose the narrowest command: `workspace list`, `project list`,
`worktree list --project <ID>`, `terminal list`, `terminal read`, or
`terminal wait`. When discovering flags from scratch, prefer
`drogon-cli agent-context --json` over guessing. For supervised work with
task ownership and completion tracking, read
`drogon-cli skills get --topic orchestration`.
